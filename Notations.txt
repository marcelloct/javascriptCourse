Javascript: High-Level, Object_oriented, Multi-paradigm programming language
programming language - instruct computer to do things
High-Level - we don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management
Object_oriented - based on objects, for storing most kinds of data
Multi-paradigm - we can use different styles of programming

variable - 'box with a value'

expression - piece of code that produce a value - 3 + 4, 1991, true && false, ...
statement -  bigger piece of code that is executed and which does not produce a value on itself / produce actions - if/else, switch, ...

data types -> Objects and primitives

primitive = number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, bigint

operators ->
math operator - let x = 10 + 5
assignment operator - x = 10, x += 10, x++
comparison operator - x > y, x <= y
equality operators - x == y, x === y, x !== y, x != y
logic operators - &&, ||, !
conditional operator - x >= 18 ? console.log() : console.log()

operators precedence - https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence

control structures: if/else

type conversion - Number(), String()
type coercion - 'I am ' + 23 + ' years old', '23' - '10' - 3

falsy values: 0, '', undefined, null, NaN
