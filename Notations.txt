Javascript: High-Level, Object_oriented, Multi-paradigm programming language
programming language - instruct computer to do things
High-Level - we don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management
Object_oriented - based on objects, for storing most kinds of data
Multi-paradigm - we can use different styles of programming

variable - 'box with a value'

data types -> Objects and primitives

primitive = number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, bigint

operators ->
math operator - let x = 10 + 5
assignment operator - x = 10, x += 10, x++
comparison operator - x > y, x <= y

operators precedence - https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence

control structures: if/else

type conversion - Number(), String()
type coercion - 'I am ' + 23 + ' years old', '23' - '10' - 3
